This script calculates the overall runoff in Kenya in gallons. The inputs include length, width and area in feet and square feet. The outputs include total rainfall in inches, length in inches, width in inches, and runoff in gallons. The problem this code is trying to solve is how much runoff will occur given a very small rainstorm in Kenya. Not only will this code aid in protecting agriculture, but it will also help to mitigate flooding or landslides. 
During this process, I received a few syntax errors but was able to debug immediately. The first error I received was an error in one of my equations.
I forgot to print the variable afterwards so upon running my equation, it did not recognize the variable for "rain_inch".
